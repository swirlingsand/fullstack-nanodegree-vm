-- same concept as winners for losers
-- ! important, make sure comparing player ID to loser in loser view

-- combine winners and losers view into a unified view
-- (winner.wins + losers.losses) = total count
-- perform join on user ID
-- in order to fulfill requirement that first entry on the list is player in first place

create view standings as
